Hi sprinters, we have great news from Vienna.

The biggest news is that the QGIS PSC voted for joining the Vienna Code 
Sprint as first choice for their next Hackfest. Stay tuned for further 
details. We will meet on IRC #tosprint today at around 4pm Vienna time for 
some discussion. Please join if you're interested.

Many thanks and welcome to our first sponsors:

* [Airborne Interactive](http://airborne.aero/) as gold sponsor
* [ITS Vienna Region](http://www.anachb.at/mehr) as silver sponsor
* [The metaspatial Institute](http://www.metaspatial.net/en/institute) as
  bronze sponsor

In the next status update I hope to be able to announce a hotel arrangement.

Finally, make sure to add yourself to the [participants 
list](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants) as 
places are filling up.

cu  
Stephan
