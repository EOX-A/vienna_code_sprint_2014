Hi sprinters, lots of things have happened here in Vienna since my last 
status update, please find a brief summary below. Besides I'd like to invite 
everybody to a planning and organization meeting via IRC (#tosprint on 
freenode) on Thursday, February 6, at 6pm CET. It's a bit early in the 
states but I hope not too early.

Probably the most interesting update is the successful negotiation of hotel 
blocks. Please see the 
[wiki](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Hotel) for 
detailed information including number of rooms and beds. Feel free to 
coordinate room shares via the wiki.

The second big update is that the GRASS GIS PSC decided to officially join 
the code sprint providing great opportunities for joint activities.

Let's hope we're not blasting the capacities of our venue as at the time of 
writing already 64 participants have registered. I'm sure we can squeeze in 
additional chairs but the wireless bandwidth... ;) Seriously, it's really 
great to attract so many excellent developers.

Finally, many thanks and welcome to the following new sponsors:

* [Austrospace](http://www.austrospace.at) as gold sponsor
