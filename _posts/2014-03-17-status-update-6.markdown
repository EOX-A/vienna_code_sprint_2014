Hi sprinters, the preparations are in their final stage and in just one week 
the welcome party will be in full swing. This is my final status update 
including directions to the code sprint venue as well as an invitation to a 
small ice breaker on Sunday evening for those already in Vienna.

The venue is not far from the center of Vienna (~25min via train and subway) 
and can be reached easily from the Vienna international airport via train.

From the airport take the train S-Bahn S7 going to Wien Floridsdorf and exit 
at Praterstern (~30min). Make sure to avoid the CAT as it doesn't bring you 
to Praterstern and I consider it too costly for gaining just 10 minutes.

From Praterstern take the subway U-Bahn U2 going to Seestadt and exit at 
Stadlau. Now either take a 15 minutes walk to the venue or take the bus 
Autobus 86A going to Breitenleer Straße/Arnikaweg or 87A going to 
Hermann-Gebauer-Straße and exit at Genochplatz.

From Praterstern instead of the U2 you can also take the subway U-Bahn U1 
particularly when going to the Hotel Hillinger. Take the U1 going to 
Leopoldau and exit at Kagran. Now take the tram Straßenbahn 25 going to 
Oberdorfstraße or the bus Autobus 26A going to Großenzersdorf and exit at 
Polgarstraße for the Hotel Hillinger or continue to Konstanziagasse for the 
code sprint venue.

If you're in Vienna already on Sunday you're invited to join us for a small 
ice breaker starting from 7pm at Green - Cafe-Wok-Grill-Restaurant which is 
located next to the sprint venue. You will see the signs when you enter the 
plaza of Star22.

On Monday we will start 9ish with some sort of "official" opening around 10.

As always don't hesitate to contact me in case of any questions. I'm looking 
forward to welcome you all in Vienna next week.
