Hi sprinters, please find below some recent updates from Vienna.

First of all we have a [new website](http://vienna2014.sprint.osgeo.org), yay.
Thanks to Daniel and Marko for helping with the domain and design. Please feel
free to send [pull requests](https://github.com/EOX-A/vienna_code_sprint_2014)
if you want to say something on the website's blog.

I've started to contact potential sponsors. Please let me know if you know
somebody I should contact our point them to the
[website](http://vienna2014.sprint.osgeo.org/sponsoring.html) directly. Many
thanks.

We are getting really excited as places are filling up. We have already 20
participants registered most of them with a "very likely" likeliness of
attendance. Thus make sure to
[add yourself](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants)
early enough before we maybe have to start a waitlist.

We are working on something big maybe unveiled in the next status update,
stay tuned.

cu
Stephan
