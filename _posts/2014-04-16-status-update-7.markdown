Hi sprinters, more than two weeks have gone by since the Vienna Code Sprint
and I hope everybody has fully recovered from the intense week after a safe
trip home. In this final status update I'd like to share some highlights as
well as some personal lessons learned.

We did two press releases in German to reach out to local media, [one at the beginning]
(http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20140324_OTS0043/entwicklerinnentreffen-von-freien-und-offenen-geographischen-informationssystemen-in-wien)
and [one afterwards]
(http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20140401_OTS0094/vienna-code-sprint-2014-zu-freien-und-offenen-geographischen-informationssystemen-ein-grosser-erfolg).

For the international audience we sent two entries to OSGeo News, again [one
at the beginning](http://www.osgeo.org/node/1434) as well as [one
afterwards](http://www.osgeo.org/node/1438). The later one includes a more
comprehensive list of highlights and achievements. Both entries
([1](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/announce/2014-March/000251.html),
[2](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/announce/2014-April/000255.html)) have
also been sent to the announce mailing list.

There are some further interesting statistics besides the [wireless
usage](/2014/04/06/wireless-usage-statistics.html):

* Quite unexpected, we used less than 1 kilo of coffee beans per day
* Extrapolating from the beer kegs we consumed more than 50 liters of beer
  per day
* We had no problems to cope with more than 30 pastry pieces per day

If you're interested in photos and comments try a search
for *#viennacodesprint14* on [twitter]
(https://twitter.com/search?q=%23viennacodesprint14).

We did really well with our budget and will return a considerable amount to
OSGeo to support future sprints.

Since I was asked for, please find below some personal lessons learned from
an organizing point of view:

* Renting a beer tap was very much appreciated but don't return it too early
* Bringing food to the venue instead of always going out saves time
* Going out one or the other day was welcomed as well
* Organizing is almost a full time job during the event and almost half time
  at least two weeks before
* Reach out to sponsors early enough and don't be disappointed if less than
  5% respond even if you mainly mail personal contacts
* Have a concrete plan for lunches and dinners for every day (minor
  adjustments will work but more than 50 participants definitely need a plan)
* Make sure to communicate the plan early enough to the participants
* A bigger supermarket in close walking distance really helps a lot
* Don't forget to buy tickets for public transport when going out
* Make sure to make restaurant reservations in a non-smoking area. Yes Mike,
  I screwed this one up, sorry ;)
* There are always higher requirements in the wireless network
  ([see usage statistics](/2014/04/06/wireless-usage-statistics.html))
* Make sure to have enough power extensions available
* Breakout rooms are quite convenient for groups to meet without disturbing
  everybody else
* Better overestimate the budget needs to have some room

Maybe those points are a helpful input to a Code Sprint Cookbook. Please
feel free to copy them for your needs.

I want to thank everybody who participated at the sprint and made it a great
event.

Once again I want to shout out a big thank you to our sponsors. I still have
a few coaster left, ping me if you're interested.
