In exchange for the returned feedback sheets about the wireless network our 
venue sponsor provided some usage statistics. In total we have downloaded 
around **140 GB** of data and the client connection durations add up to 
**4900 hours** from more than **300 unique clients**.

The figure below shows the number of connected clients over time using 5 
minutes intervals with the highest peak on Tuesday afternoon with more than 
**120 simultaneously connected clients**.

The second figure shows the cumulative throughput of all clients over time. 
During the day we used constantly between 5 and 10 Mbps with peaks above 17 
Mbps.

The total download volume per client reveals some heavy users where the 
winner downloaded almost 13GB but also a fairly big number of clients with 
rather low download volume.

As I'm not a statistics expert please let me know if you're interested in 
any other analysis I'll gladly try to provide.
