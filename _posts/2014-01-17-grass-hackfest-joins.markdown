We are glad to announce that the GRASS GIS PSC decided to join the Vienna Code Sprint 2014. We are looking forward to a great week with a lot of interproject discussions and joint activities. See the [GRASS wiki page](http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GRASS_Community_Sprint_Vienna_2014) and the [GRASS Developers mailing list](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/grass-dev) for more info related to GRASS participation in the Vienna Code Sprint.

Currently already 55 participants have registered. Thus make sure to get your name in and add it to the [participants list](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants). Meet you in Vienna!!
