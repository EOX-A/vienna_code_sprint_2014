All, let me briefly summarize the current status of the planning for the
Vienna Code Sprint 2014.

The date is fixed for the week of March 24-28 2014. Question: Any
objections to going for a full week?

The venue is reserved and blocked for us.

If you plan to attend, please add yourself to the list of participants on the 
[wiki page](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants) 
indicating any special needs.

Finally please let me know any potential sponsors you think I should
contact. I'm planning to approach them in the next couple of weeks, also
at FOSS4G.

I plan to send updates more or less regularly as interesting stuff
happens. I'm looking forward to welcome all of you in Vienna.

cu  
Stephan
