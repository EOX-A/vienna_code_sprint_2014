Hi sprinters, things are progressing nicely and we started working on the 
general schedule including social activities. We will be visiting the venue 
again on Thursday to clarify last details. Please let me know any points you 
want us to address there.

In the evening of the first day of the sprint we will invite all sprinters 
to a big welcome party. More details shall not be revealed yet but we try to 
make it a memorable event.

On Wednesday evening we invite interested participants to a guided evening 
walk - "The City of Vienna at a glance". An on-site registration will be 
needed due to a limit number of 25 places.

The downtown tour introduces the imperial city, Vienna´s great history, its 
unique architecture, and todays life-style.

Meeting in front of St. Stephen´s Cathedral, Vienna’s main 900 years old 
landmark, we will stroll along Graben and Kohlmarkt, passing former court 
confectionary Demel and the most exclusive shops in Vienna. Crossing the 
courtyards of the Imperial Palace "Hofburg" you will hear about the great 
times of former Austrian monarchy, see where Empress Elizabeth (Sisi) 
married Emperor Franz Joseph, where the Vienna Boys’ Choir sings mass on 
Sunday, and where the famous white Lipizzaner stallions of the Spanish 
Riding School perform. You will enjoy the great view from Heroes Square to 
some of the magnificent buildings of the famous Ringstraße. We will continue 
walking towards State Opera and the legendary hotel Sacher and will end the 
tour at Albertinaplatz.

As always don't hesitate to contact me in case of any questions.

cu  
Stephan
