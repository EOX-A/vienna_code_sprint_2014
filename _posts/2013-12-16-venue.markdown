Today I had the chance to visit the venue of the Code Sprint. I have been 
there for the first time and I can say it's a really nice place. The 
building is brand new and has a couple of nice restaurant and shops around. 
I took a couple of images to give you an impression.

The first is a panoramic shot of the big room: <img

room panorama" class="img-rounded img-responsive"/>

This is again the big room as seen from the main door. In the middle back 
you can see the door to the smaller room: <img

class="img-rounded img-responsive"/>

This is just outside of the rooms and a smaller room which we might also get 
the chance to use if needed: <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/Venue_3.jpg" 
alt="Hall" title="Hall" class="img-rounded img-responsive"/>

Finally I took some images from outside. On the upper two you can see the 
entrance (right below the flags) as well as the windows of the rooms (just 
right of the entrance). The lower two show the building from the other side 
where you also have some restaurants and shops. <img

class="img-rounded img-responsive"/>

I'm really looking forward to a great week.

Many thanks again to the City of Vienna MA 14!
