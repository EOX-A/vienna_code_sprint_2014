Thanks to our generous venue sponsor, the [City of Vienna](http://www.wien.gv.at/english/administration/ict/index.html), we were able to invite the [QGIS community](http://qgis.org/) to join the Code Sprint with their Hackfest. We are glad that the QGIS PSC decided for Vienna and we are looking forward to a great week with a lot of interproject discussions and joint activities. See the QGIS developer mailing list for the [official announcement](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2013-December/029766.html).

The number of available places has been increased and we are now planning for 50-60 participants. Currently already 43 participants have registered. Thus make sure to get your name in and add it to the [participants list](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Vienna_Code_Sprint_2014#Participants).
