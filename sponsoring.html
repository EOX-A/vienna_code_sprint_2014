        <h1>Support and promote!</h1>
        <p>We encourage sponsors to support nutriment and entertainment for the sprinters as they work hard and play hard for five productive days. Contributions will be put towards lunch, snacks, and dinner costs for the sprinters, and potentially bringing in sprinters who might otherwise be unable to attend. Any surplus at the end of the event will be turned over to OSGeo or used for a future code sprint.</p>
